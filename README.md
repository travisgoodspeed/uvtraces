Howdy y'all,

This repo contains traces of ultraviolet erasure of EPROM, EEPROM and
Flash memories.  It also has some traces of these memories being
glitched by laser pointer or other light sources that temporarily
change their values without a real erase.

I produced these to better understand the erasing process and how it
might be applied to protection fuses.  As raw data, it might or might
not be of use to you.
